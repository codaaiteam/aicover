  "userReviews": "Community Feedback",
  "review1": "The motion quality and prompt adherence set new standards for open-source video generation.",
  "review2": "The simple, hackable architecture makes it perfect for research and experimentation.",
  "review3": "Impressive results with the efficient single T5-XXL language model approach.",
  "faq1Question": "What makes Mochi 1 unique?",
  "faq1Answer": "Mochi 1 represents a significant advancement in open-source video generation, featuring a 10B parameter diffusion model with novel AsymmDiT architecture, offering high-fidelity motion and strong prompt adherence while being completely open source.",
  "faq2Question": "What are the technical specifications?",
  "faq2Answer": "Mochi 1 generates 480p videos using a 10B parameter model with 8x8 spatial and 6x temporal compression. The model requires 4 H100 GPUs for inference and uses a single T5-XXL for prompt encoding.",
  "faq3Question": "How does the architecture work?",
  "faq3Answer": "The AsymmDiT architecture efficiently processes prompts alongside compressed video tokens, using multi-modal self-attention with separate MLP layers for each modality and non-square QKV projections for reduced memory requirements.",
  "faq4Question": "What are the current limitations?",
  "faq4Answer": "The current research preview is limited to 480p resolution, may show minor warping in extreme motion cases, and is optimized for photorealistic rather than animated content.",
